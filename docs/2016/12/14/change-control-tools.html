<p><a href="https://www.fogcreek.com/fogbugz/">FogBugz</a> is the cornerstone of our

<h2 id="lucid-chart">Lucid Chart</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.lucidchart.com/">Lucid Chart</a> is a tool we use for Wireframing and
flow charts.  Everything in Lucid Chart is stored in Google Drive, and
accessible via a web link, so the wireframes and charts are easily shared.</p>
