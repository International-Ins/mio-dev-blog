        <title>Developer Tools - Jack</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We developers &lt;strong&gt;love&lt;/strong&gt; our tools; here are Jack’s favorites.
&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;
Tools can make all the difference in the world to a developer.  Everything from
the keyboard you physically type on, to the browser you test code in.  It all
lends a hand in making developers as efficient as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;physical-interface&quot;&gt;Physical Interface&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s get it out of the way… I develop on a 15” MacBook Pro.  Why, you may
ask?  I find that it is much more efficient to develop on a machine as close
to the server as possible and MacOS is a close cousin to the Linux based
servers where MIO runs.  MacOS also alleviates the hassle of configuring
monitors, networks, keyboards, mice, etc, that you may find in a Linux
environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also use gaming accessories for things like a
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.razerzone.com/&quot;&gt;Razer&lt;/a&gt; Blackwidow Ultimate keyboard, and an old
Razer Naga mouse I had lying around.  I find they are very comfortable to me, 
and a joy to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;editor&quot;&gt;Editor&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last year I’ve switched from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vim.org/&quot;&gt;vim&lt;/a&gt; to Github’s
&lt;a href=&quot;https://atom.io/&quot;&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt; editor.  Atom provides the same great keyboard-only
experience as vim, but with community plugins and some additional features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;terminal&quot;&gt;Terminal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to start servers and really get around in a Unix-like OS (such as
MacOS), a good terminal is required.  MacOS’s built in Terminal is fantastic,
but I find &lt;a href=&quot;https://hyper.is/&quot;&gt;Hyper&lt;/a&gt;’s customization to be worth the switch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also run ZSH for my shell, and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh&quot;&gt;Oh-My-ZSH&lt;/a&gt; to add tools to the
command line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;virtualization&quot;&gt;Virtualization&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MIO uses a lot of tools in many different languages. In order to keep these all
neat and tidy, we make extensive use of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.docker.com/&quot;&gt;Docker&lt;/a&gt;. 
Docker allows me to have different development environments running on the
same machine without clomping all over each other.  As an example, this blog
is written using a version of Ruby that would conflict with the version we use
to develop custom UI’s for some agents.  Before Docker, it could take hours of
work to switch between those two projects.  With Docker I can ignore that
dependancy and just start working.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Change Control Process Tools</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;MIO’s Change control process keeps everyone on track and on time.
&lt;!-- /excerpt --&gt;
Our Change Control Process (CCP) was developed to bridge the gap between our
business (insurance) interests and our development (IT) interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our process is broken up into XXX distinct phases:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Feature Requests - Agents or Underwriters request a new feature or a
change to an existing feature.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Documentation - Our Project Manager gathers requirements from the agent or
underwriter in order to create documentation and wireframes of the feature.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Approval - All documentation requires approval by MIO’s management team.
This is to ensure that the request has been fully captured into the
documentation.  A priority and timeline are also set.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Implementation - A developer, designer, or systems administrator, take the
documentation and begin implenting the change.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Testing - A tester, using a staging environment, rigerously tests all
aspects of the system that may be affected by the change at hand.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Acceptance - MIO’s management team and the agent or underwriter who
requested the change are given a change to ensure that the&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fogbugz&quot;&gt;FogBugz&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fogcreek.com/fogbugz/&quot;&gt;FogBugz&lt;/a&gt; is the cornerstone of our
development process.  In FogBugz, we use their Wiki functionality for creating
and keeping track of our documentation (but not wireframing), their ticketing
system for tracking individual change requests, their planner for managing
sprints and estimates, and their
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fogcreek.com/fogbugz/devhub&quot;&gt;Dev Hub&lt;/a&gt; for managing our source code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lucid-chart&quot;&gt;Lucid Chart&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lucidchart.com/&quot;&gt;Lucid Chart&lt;/a&gt; is a tool we use for Wireframing and
flow charts.  Everything in Lucid Chart is stored in Google Drive, and
accessible via a web link, so the wireframes and charts are easily shared.&lt;/p&gt;
